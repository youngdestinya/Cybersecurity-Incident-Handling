#Cybersecurity Incident Handling

At about 2.00 PM on October 20, 2021, as the Senior IT Engineer (Cybersecurity/Cloud) in the Oil and Gas Free Zones Authority, during a routine inspection of security reports generated by the Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) systems, one of the security controls implemented as part of the organisation information security management systems (ISMS), spotted a report of suspicious exfiltration of a sensitive financial document. The ATP flagged a particular email with an attachment as being suspicious. The email which was sent from the Authority’s Financial Controller to an external email contained several company’s sensitive documents as attachments.  IT security team quickly reached out to the Financial Controller to inquire if he had sent such a mail. It was discovered he never sent nor authorised such communications. It was therefore established that there was a security breach within the company’s email system.

Details of how this incident was handled is presented in the attached document.
